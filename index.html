        <div class="title">Is college worth the cost?</div>
        We set out to find what makes a college education valuable (experience is invaluable, so we just followed the money and went from there). <br/><br/> What lands you in a good spot after college - private vs public, location, something else? Where does your money go? And the kids that dropout - are they justified? Scroll down to find out.
